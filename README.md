# About me
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a spanish 90s guy having a hard time to keep a distro for longer than a few months.
- ðŸ‘€ You might see me wandering into backend, scripting, infrastructure and many other things.

# Career background
- Early years as BI developer mostly into Oracle ecosystem ETLs.
- Minor collabs and maintenance on some backend code in Java and PHP.
- Jumped into the infra world in 2018. AWS, Ansible, Terraform, Linux, Python... A whole new world.

# Personal projects
- A FoundryVTT accessibility module using JS.
- Some MQTT PoC with AWs and terraform.
- Some basic PoC for Azure terraform instance creation.
- This is a work in progress. I have the skills but no direction to direct them.
